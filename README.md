# Order-Header-Display
ABAP Program for Order Header Display

This ABAP program retrieves and displays order header information based on user-selected order numbers. It utilizes a structure ty_header to define the data structure and an internal table lt_header to store the fetched data. Users can specify order numbers using a selection option (s_order). The displayed data includes order number, order date, payment mode, and currency. The program allows users to sort the displayed data in either ascending or descending order based on the order number. The PF status is set to 'FUNCTION' for enhanced user interaction.
